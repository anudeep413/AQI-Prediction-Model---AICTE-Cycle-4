# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction_AICTE-Cycle-4
About this project:
        Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Model is a machine learning or statistical model used to estimate future air quality levels based on various environmental and meteorological factors. The AQI is a numerical scale that represents air pollution levels,typically ranging from 0 to 500, where lower values indicate better air quality and higher values indicate hazardous conditions.
Key Components of an AQI Prediction Model:
Input Features:
Pollutants Data: Concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃,etc.
Meteorological Factors: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure.
Time-Based Factors: Seasonal variations, day-night cycles.
Prediction Techniques:
        Machine Learning: Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks.
        Deep Learning: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series forecasting.
        Statistical Models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
Data Sources:
        Government air quality monitoring stations,
        Satellite imagery,
        IoT sensors.
Applications:
        Early warnings for pollution spikes,
        Smart city planning,
        Public health advisories,
        Industrial emissions monitoring.
